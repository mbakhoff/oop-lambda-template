/**
 * TASK 2.
 *
 * Write a helper method for asking user input (an integer) from a Scanner.
 * It should ask again if the entered number does not satisfy the given conditions (checked with a lambda).
 * It should ask again if the entered text is not a number at all.
 *
 * An example run of the given program should go as follows:
 *
 * Choose a number between 1 and 100: 0
 * Choose a number between 1 and 100: 1234
 * Choose a number between 1 and 100: -10
 * Choose a number between 1 and 100: text
 * Choose a number between 1 and 100: 12
 * Wrong answer!
